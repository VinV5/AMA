# AMA - Askinator

Askinator is an AMA (Ask me anything) application which allows experts to submit AMA sessions about any topic of their choosing. Users
can submit questions during a questioning period about anything they can think of to that session and the expert will respond after
that questioning period is over. Users can also vote for AMAs/questions they like or support. This vote is counted and changes the 
rank of the AMA/question accordingly.
